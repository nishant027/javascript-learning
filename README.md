## Running JavaScript in a Browser

To run the JavaScript code in your browser's console, follow these steps:

1. **Create an HTML File**: You will need an HTML file to execute your JavaScript code. You can create a new HTML file using a text editor of your choice. For example, create a file named `index.html`.

2. **Include JavaScript File**: Inside your HTML file, include a `<script>` tag to reference the JavaScript file you want to run. For example:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>JavaScript Learning</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <!-- Your HTML content here -->

       <!-- Include your JavaScript file -->
       <script src="path/to/your/javascript-file.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Replace `"path/to/your/javascript-file.js"` with the actual path to the JavaScript file you want to run.

3. **Open the HTML File in a Browser**: Save the HTML file and open it in your web browser.

4. **Access the Console**: Open your browser's developer tools. Most browsers allow you to access the console by right-clicking on the web page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," then navigating to the "Console" tab.

5. **Execute JavaScript**: You can now write JavaScript code directly in the console and run it by pressing Enter. Any output or errors will be displayed in the console.
